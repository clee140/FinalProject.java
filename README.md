# FinalProject.java
This program implements an investment value calculator using Java FX. The program calculates the future value of an
investment at a given interest rate for a specified number of years. The user will enter the initial investment
amount (in dollars), an annual interest rate (e.g. 3.5 corresponds to 3.5%), and the number of years associated with
the investment. When the user clicks on the calculate button, the program calculates and displays the future value
of the investment.
